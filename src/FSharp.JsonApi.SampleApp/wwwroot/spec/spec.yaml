    # Introduction
    
    This API and specification is a demo for showing how to create (and
    document) an API using [FSharp.JsonApi](https://github.com/cmeeren/FSharp.JsonApi/).

    ## Definitions
    
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP
    14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14)
    [[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)]
    [[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they
    appear in all capitals, as shown here.
    
    
    
    ## Versioning
    
    This API specification follows [Semantic Versioning
    v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). In particular:
    
    * The **major** version is incremented for backwards incompatible changes
      (e.g. removing deprecated interfaces).
    * The **minor** version is incremented when new functionality is added in a
      backwards compatible manner.
    * The **patch** version is optionally incremented for backwards compatible
      changes that do not add new functionality, such as bug fixes or editorial
      changes not affecting the functionality.
    
    
    ### Version history
    
    #### 1.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)
    
    * Initial release
    
    
    ## On the format of this specification
    
    This API conforms to the [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org) standard.
    Familiarity with the [JSON-API v1.0 specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/)
    is assumed throughout this documentation.
    
    The central part of this documentation is the definition of the JSON-API
    resources provided by the API, together with the endpoints and operations by
    which these resources may be queried and manipulated. The technicalities of
    the JSON-API response format and its semantics, as well as some runtime
    behavior (such as guaranteed status codes for some specific error
    conditions), are handled by the JSON-API specification.
    
    You can use the download button at the top of this page to download the raw
    OpenAPI YAML file used to generate this page, with all model definitions,
    operations, etc. Note however that the sole purpose of the YAML file is to
    render this document, and no guarantees can be made about the stability of
    exactly how the YAML file defines and composes models, paths, etc. JSON-API
    is a complex and rich specification that does not mesh perfectly with
    OpenAPI, so API clients might be better off using an existing JSON-API
    client library rather than using the YAML file to generate client code.
    
    To facilitate simpler testing and integration, this is not a purely
    link-driven hypermedia API. In particular, this specification guarantees a
    static URL structure that may be safely hardcoded. (However, clients are of
    course free to use any documented links provided in the responses if
    desired).
    
    *Note: OpenAPI is path-focused, but if you wish not to document a static URL
    structure, you can work around it by for example replacing paths such as
    `/persons/{id}` with `{person.links.self}` and `/persons/{id}/articles` with
    `{person.relationships.articles.links.related}`.*
    
    
    ### Conventions
    
    * Unless otherwise specified, all operations support `fields` and `include`.
      By default, all fields are included, and no related resources are
      included.
      
    * All resource relationship endpoints work according to the JSON-API
      specification and will not be listed here unless they provide additional
      non-standard functionality.
    
    * The response formats and examples only specify the most important data.
      Responses may contain additional data such as included resources and
      relationship linkage as per the JSON-API specification.
    
    * The stand-alone resource definitions are provided from a response
      perspective (e.g. whether properties are marked as "required", see the
      section below on optional vs. required parameters).
    
    
    ## Technical requirements and recommendations
    
    
    ### Comply with the JSON-API specification
    
    Clients and servers MUST comply with the JSON-API specification unless
    otherwise noted. Any parts of this specification that does not comply with
    the JSON-API specification MUST explicitly state that it deviates from the
    JSON-API specification.
    
    If this specification deviates from the JSON-API specification without
    explicitly stating so, this should be considered a bug in the specification
    and the documented behavior is undefined. Please contact us to report bugs
    in the API or its specification.
    
    
    ### Don't depend on unspecified runtime behaviour
    
    Clients MUST NOT depend on observed runtime behavior not recognized by this
    specification or the JSON-API specification. This includes, but is not
    limited to, HTTP status codes. Behaviour that is not guaranteed by this
    specification or the JSON-API specification may change at any time. This
    specification is the sole contract by which clients and servers should
    communicate.
    
    If the server implementation violates this specification, that must be
    considered a bug in either the specification or the server implementation.
    Please contact us to report bugs in the API or its specification.
    
    
    ### Resource IDs have no semantic meaning
    
    Clients MUST NOT parse or construct resource IDs based on assumed semantic
    meaning.
    
    If clients need to act on semantic information that only seems to be present
    in a resource identifier, please contant us to have the API extended with
    the necessary semantic information/functionality.
    
    
    ### Ignore unrecognized members
    
    Clients and servers MUST ignore members, headers, and parameters not
    recognized by this specification or the JSON-API specification.
    
    
    ### Parameters are non-null by default
    
    Clients and servers MUST NOT use `null` as a value for any parameter unless
    the parameter is explicitly specified as nullable. Note that nullability of
    globally defined parameters (e.g. resource fields) may be explicitly
    overridden for specific requests/responses.
    
    
    ### Parameters are optional by default
    
    Clients MAY omit any request parameter (in query, header, or body) and
    servers MAY omit any response parameter (in header or body) unless
    explicitly required by this specification or the JSON-API specification.
    Note that whether a globally defined parameter (e.g. a resource field) is
    required may be overridden for specific requests/responses.
    
      * Exception: Resource fields (attributes and relationships) marked as
        required may still be excluded from responses according to
        client-supplied sparse fieldsets.
      * Exception: If all attributes or relationships are excluded using sparse
        fieldsets, the `attributes` and `relationships` objects may be omitted
        even if marked as required
    
    
    ### Consider using sparse fieldsets
    
    Clients SHOULD use sparse fieldsets to specify the desired attributes and
    relationships.
    
    Using sparse fieldsets to exclude unneeded attributes and relationships may
    have a notable impact on performance for large responses. This particularly
    goes for relationships due to the overhead of the relationship links.
    
    Even if a client needs all currently defined fields for a resource, using
    sparse fieldsets means that the addition of new fields won't slow down
    existing requests.
    
    Furthermore, always using sparse fieldsets makes it easier for the API
    developers to monitor which fields are used. This makes it easier to tune
    performance and safer to remove deprecated fields.
    
    
    ### Deprecation
    
    Responses to any request using deprecated interfaces (such as deprecated
    request parameters) SHOULD contain a `Deprecated` header describing which
    deprecated interfaces were used. Clients SHOULD monitor this header.
    
    Deprecated interfaces SHOULD specify a time of removal in this specification
    and in the `Deprecated` header, and MAY be removed earlier than the
    pre-determined time if the interface is unused.
    
    Clients MUST NOT use deprecated interfaces they previously did not use.
    
    
    ### Error responses
    
    The returned JSON-API error objects SHOULD contain an error code that
    unambiguously specifies the error condition.
    
    Servers MAY return other error codes than those recognized by this
    specification. For example, endpoints may return unspecified error codes
    related to contract violations (e.g. invalid syntax, missing required
    parameters), which are expected to be caught in development/testing and are
    not useful to govern client runtime behavior.
   
    The following error codes may occur for any operation:
    
    | Code               | Description |
    |--------------------|-------------|
    | `UnknownError`     | An unknown error occurred.
    | `Unauthorized`     | The authorization was missing or invalid for this operation.
    | `ResourceNotFound` | The operation refers to a resource that does not exist.
    
    
    ## API implementation notes
   
    The following points are intended as helpful notes regarding our API
    implementation. They are not part of the specification.
   
    * Some database queries have long cache times under the assumption that the
      data changes very infrequently and that when they do change, API clients
      do not need 100% up-to-date data. Please contact us if you find stale API
      data to be a problem.
    
    * Since pagination is implemented using offset/limit, the pagination windows
      are unstable (i.e., new data may be added or deleted at any time,
      potentially causing missed or duplicated results when switching pages).
